# Project Overview

Unveil Cards on Scroll is a web project that enhances user interaction and engagement by revealing product, service, and informational cards dynamically as users scroll through the page. This feature provides a smooth and visually appealing way to showcase various content types without overwhelming the visitor. By implementing scroll-triggered animations, the project aims to create an immersive, intuitive browsing experience that improves user retention and exploration.



## Features
- Scroll-Triggered Card Display: Product, service, and info cards reveal progressively as users scroll down the page, creating a fluid and engaging experience.

- Responsive Design: The cards are designed to adjust seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimized user experience across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

- Smooth Animation Effects: Subtle animations make each card appear on scroll, drawing attention and enhancing the visual appeal of your website.

- Customizable Content: Cards can be tailored to display various types of content including products, services, testimonials, or key information, giving businesses full control over their content layout.

- Interactive User Journey: The scroll interaction encourages users to explore more content without the need for clicks, improving website interactivity.
